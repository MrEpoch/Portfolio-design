            I am a Front-end developer who is skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

            My JavaScript extends to React library and React Native Framework.

          <li>
            Experience with a few npm libraries and packages like framer-motion
            for animating and THREE.js for stunning 3D models.

          <li>
            I have some ventures with Firebase as a backend with Auth and

              Well, i think this one is pretty obvius, but yes i can use HTML.üëè
              I done fair share of HTML projects and can say that without
              frameworks i would be lost in size of my document.

              Understanding grid, flexbox, and media queries, animations,
              transitions. I can style my code too, although i would like to say
              that nothing is more painful than styling my code.

            <h4>JavaScript</h4>

              From my part i can work with JS from basic methods to async and
              frameworks. It is hard to say what is considered being good at
              JavaScript with amounts of libraries and frameworks.

              I don't believe in that someone now writes huge apps with vanilla
              JS. React although not that friendly has great community with lot
              of packages, libraries and big popularity.

              This was my main reason to learn JavaScript and React and i can
              say that my first experience styling something with it was
              horrible. But Nativewind helped me to overcame it.

              For now i am only at level of using it with async and await, i
              haven't created some great server or API with it, but will soon.

              I share majority of my projects on github with it.
              Without git, my projects would be mess, i remember that when i was starting out i was truly naming copies of projects v1, v2 v3.

              As normal Front-end developer who wants backend and don't have for
              now time to learn it, is firebase great solution to problem, i am
              building project with Auth, Firestore, and their Storage.
