            <h4>HTML</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              Well, i think this one is pretty obvius, but yes i can use HTML.üëè
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              I can style my code too, although i would like to say that nothing is more painful than styling my code.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              In this time and age, what is considered as being skilled with JS is hard to define. From my part i work with JS from basic methods to async.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>React</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              I don't believe in that someone now writes huge apps with vanilla JS. React although not that friendly has great community with lot of packages and libraries.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>React Native</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              This was my main reason to learn JavaScript and React and i can say that my first experience styling something with it was horrible. But Nativewind helped me to overcame it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>Node.js</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              For now i am only at level of using it with async and await, i haven't created some great server or API with it, but will soon.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>Git</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              Withouh git i would be lost in names of copies of all of my projects. I share majority of my projects on github with it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>Three.js</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              I tried blender to design items, but i found spline at web a lot easier to use. I am still learning how to use it, but i am sure i will get there.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-skills-item">
            <h4>Firebase services</h4>
            <p className="about-skills-item-p">
              As normal Front-end developer who wants backend and don't have for now time to learn it is firebase great solution to problem, i am building project with Auth, Firestore, and their Storage.
